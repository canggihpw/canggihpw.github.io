            In the beginning, I actually just wanted to draw Doraemon's head. Thus, I set the origin coordinates (0,0)
            to align with the center of the head. 
            The first line that I drew was the outer line of the Doraemon's head. To make it easir for further drawing, I split the outer line into two lines: top and bottom parts.
            I create the top part using Eq. \eqref{eq:one} as follows:

            $$ 
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:one}
            y_1(x) = \sqrt{(12-x^2)}
            \end{equation}
            $$
            
            As for the bottom part, it is quite tricky since we are not drawing a full half-circle like the top one. 
            We have to make an empty area for Doraemon's collar. To deal with this, I use piece-wise function in Eq. \eqref{eq:two} to draw two arcs of outer head.
    
            $$
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:two}
            y_2(x) =
            \begin{cases}
            - y_1(x) & \text{for } x \leq -2.2 \\
            - y_1(x) & \text{for } x \geq 2.2
            \end{cases}
            \end{equation}
            $$

            Finally, we got the basic lines of the Doraemon's head.

            <div class="col-md-3">
                <img src="contents/doraemon/2.jpg" width="100%">
            </div>
    
            <div class="col-md-9" style="text-align: justify;">
                Using similar technique, we draw more lines. 
                The most challenging part here is how to colorize the are. For example, the Doramemon's eyeball here.
                At first time, it seems complicated, but once you get used to, it is easy.
                I use implicit equation as shown in Eq. \eqref{eq:three}. Here, we colorize the area between two functions: $d_1(x)$ and $d_2(x)$. 
                We also set the limit of $x$ value. The result is shown in the image left.
                $$
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:three}
                d_2(x) \leq y \leq d_1(x) \{0.478 \leq x \leq 1 \}
                \end{equation},
                $$
                where,
                $$ d_1(x) = \sqrt{0.125 - (x-0.5)^2} + 2 $$
                $$ d_2(x) = - \sqrt{0.125 - (x-0.5)^2} + 2 $$

                How do I found those exact function? Using intuition, experience, and a bit trial-error. So, just do it, and feel the excitement. :D
